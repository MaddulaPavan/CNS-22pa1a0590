A Message Authentication Code (MAC) is a cryptographic technique used to verify the integrity and authenticity of a message. It ensures that the message has not been tampered with and is from a legitimate sender. This project implements a simple MAC using HMAC-SHA256 in Python, where a secret key and a hash function are used to generate and verify the MAC.
